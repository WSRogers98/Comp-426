            <p id="puggy">Despite their petite stature, pugs are full of personality. They are most well known for their short snout, curly tail, large head, and protruding eyes. Unlike many dog breeds, Pugs were not bred to perform a task. They are not hunters, guard dogs, or retrievers; instead, they are companion dogs.</p>
